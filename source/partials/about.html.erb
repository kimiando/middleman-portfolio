            It was challenging for me to decide on a career path, especially with the added gap caused by the pandemic after graduating from university in 2020. Since then, I‚Äôve explored different things, but nothing truly sparked my interest. However, when something does, I pursue it.

            I initially enrolled in a foundations course with no prior coding experience and learned JavaScript fundamentals in late 2022. However, it didn‚Äôt quite fit me as my first coding language. This led me to transition to learning Ruby, giving coding another chance.

            My coding journey began with Le Wagon Tokyo‚Äôs two-month immersive course from October to December 2023, providing me with opportunities to collaborate with buddies and groups. It was during this experience that I discovered my motivation for coding ‚Äî to transform my ideas into reality through code. Nothing excites me more than seeing them come to life.

            Beyond coding, I find joy in sports like cable wakeboarding and snowboarding (newbie) üèÇ

            I‚Äôm also a coffee and matcha enthusiast! If you happen to be in Tokyo, I‚Äôd love to meet up for a cup, and maybe we can enjoy some cake as well.
